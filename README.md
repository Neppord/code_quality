Code Quality
============

A book in the making.

This book is intended for those who want to know more about code quality.
Not as a list of hard coded rules but as a philosophical guide with some concrete examples.

I could have named it "Design Principals" but for me design is something that most of the time is done upfront while code is something you write continuously. There for its more helpfull and usefull to think about general code quality and define good design from those rules.

Enough babbeling lets get going.
